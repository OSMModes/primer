# Primer and Tektonic

This fork of primer and tekton (Tektonic) is aimed to be a firmware built for conjuring. Some of the biggest differences are

* Conjure mode is enabled by default
* Conjure mode does not get disabled during sleep
* The color set can be changed by either double clicking or utilizing the color-switch timers.
